    "# Notebook 4 – Predictions and visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "- Load the latest trained model.\n",
    "- Fetch weather forecast for at least the next day and build future features.\n",
    "- Generate price predictions for the forecast horizon.\n",
    "- Optionally write predictions to a `electricity_prices_predictions` feature group.\n",
    "- Produce plots (hourly price forecast, forecast vs actual) and save them under `plots/` for the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Document where plots are stored and naming conventions.\n",
    "- Mention any steps needed when the model version changes.\n",
    "- Indicate how often this notebook is expected to run.\n"
