    "# Notebook 5 – Regular retraining\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "- Retrain the model on new data on a regular cadence (e.g., weekly).\n",
    "- Compare the new model against the current production model.\n",
    "- If the new model is better, promote it (save/overwrite the production version).\n",
    "- Log results, metrics, and the decision (kept or replaced production).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Define training frequency and data window to use.\n",
    "- Describe evaluation metrics and thresholds for promotion.\n",
    "- Record the latest retraining date and any issues encountered.\n"
